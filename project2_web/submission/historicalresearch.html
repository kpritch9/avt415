			<h3>History behind the fiction</h3>
			<p> I love history!  I've been a reader all my life, but it wasn't until I took an elective class on Peter the Great in college that I came to understand what great stories the past holds.  
				Did you know that Peter the Great was almost 7 feet tall at a time when the average man was 5' 4"?  Or that he traveled to Holland while he was Czar and worked for months as an 
				apprentice ship builder?  Stranger than fiction--no?  
			</p>
			<p>	So now I am playing out my long-time ambition to meld my love of great stories with my love of history by writing historical fiction.  
				On this page I plan to provide some of my thoughts on history and fiction and point the reader towards some interesting information on both.
