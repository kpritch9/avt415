			<h3>About the Author</h3>
			<p> Wayne grew up in a tiny cotton town in rural Louisiana where hunting, fishing and farming were a way of life. 
				Between chopping cotton, dove hunting, and Little League ball, he developed a love of great adventure stories like <em>Call It Courage</em> and <em>Kidnapped</em>.  
				The one gift he always requested for Christmas was books!
			</p>
			<p> Like most southern boys of that era, Wayne saw the military as an honorable and adventurous career--and a way out of the cotton patch. 
				Members of his family had served in the Army in every American war since the Civil War (save the Spanish American War), so it was a natural step for him to attend and graduate from West Point. 
				He just missed Vietnam, but found that life as a Captain in an army broken by that war was not what he wanted. 
			</p>	
			<p> After tours in Germany and Korea, 
				he returned to Louisiana and civilian life and began a 10 year career in government, including four years as a senior official in the Pentagon during the Reagan administration. 
				During those years he saw the US Army reborn from its post-Vietnam nadir to become the outstanding force it remains today.
			</p>
			<p> Through it all, Wayne retained his love of great adventure writing and when he had two sons he began telling them stories before bedtime. Those stories became his first novel, <em>Longbow</em>.   
				He thought that telling the story of Roland Inness would be a trilogy, and did manage to get the essential "coming of age" story done in four books:  <em>Longbow</em>, <em>Warbow</em>, 
				<em>The Broken Realm and The Ransomed Crown</em>.  
			</p>
			<p> He intended to move on to other stories, but so many people around the world had embraced Roland and Declan and Millicent, 
				that he knew he was not done.  <em>A Prince of Wales</em> was published in 2017 and took Roland back into Wales to help Llywelyn the Great win his crown and in 2108 Wayne published Declan 
				O'Duinne which takes Roland's faithful comrade back home to Ireland.  Wayne finished <em>A Question of Honour</em>, the final book in <em>The Saga of Roland Inness</em> in October, 2019.  
				He doesn't know if he will ever return to Roland's world, but he'd never rule it out entirely.
			</p>
			<br /> <br />
			<h3>A Note From Wayne</h3>
			<p> "At present, I am well into a new story with new characters, but with echoes to the past.  Set in 1650 it begins in England but moves to the wilderness of colonial America.  
				<em>No King, No Country</em> has just been released in fall of 2020, and I hope you'll give it a try."
